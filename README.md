# MAD-Project-Final
Syed Zayaan Nashrid(011161127). United International University(UIU) Spring 2022 Mobile Application and Development Final Project

As the title says, this is a repository for my Mobile Application Development class. It's a simple text adventure game made using fragments, textviews, and buttons.

Developed by: Zayaan Nashird(011161127)
Language: Java, XML

# Start Screen
This is the start screen. It's a simple activity that has three buttons. The play button that starts the main game, the score button that takes the player to a screen showing all the scores(as of yet incomplete), and an exit button. The exit button is simple, so I didn't waste time implementing it.

# GameScreen
This is, as it states, the main game screen. It's one activity with one fragmentcontainerview. The fragments change as the user clicks button, bringing changes when necessary. As the player finds more items, the score increases and is kept track of internally by the game. The score is not shown to the player as a means of having a surprise. Unfortunately, it's not as fully developed
